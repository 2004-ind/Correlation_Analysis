# Correlation_Analysis

## Correlation Study Between Financial Sectors
### Protecting Portfolios Using Correlation Diversification

Project Description/ Outline:

Our objective is to search through various market sectors and find those that are least correlated to each other historically. We will analyze 11 economic sectors plus equities, bonds, cryptocurrency, commodities and currencies.  By using a diverse set of tools such as MC Simulations, Numpy, and Pandas we will then attempt to predict which market sectors will stay uncorrelated in the future by performing quantitative analysis.   

Ultimately, we want to know how each sector correlates with the rest of the market. Uncorrelated strategies diversify risk and may protect against catastrophic losses across a portfolio.   This application seeks to identify opportunities to invest in non-correlated assets to diversify portfolio.

Research Questions to Answer:

* Which sectors are correlated?
* What influences the correlation between these sectors?
* Which assets are likely to be uncorrelated in the future?
* How much time is there between one sector influencing another sector?
* How does investing in uncorrelated classes impact sharpe ratio?

**Central Focus:**
* Bonds 
* Crypto (NFT/ Gaming)
* Gold 
* Real Estate 
* Healthcare
* Materials 
* Consumer Staples
* Consumer Discretionary (Entertainment)
* Utilities 
* Energy 
* Industrials
* Consumer Services 
* Financials 
* Technology
* Metaverse 
* Commodities
* Currencies
